## Installation and Overview of SandPiper

* [SandPiper](https://www.redwoodeda.com/products) is a code generator that generates readable, well-structured, Verilog or SystemVerilog\ code from the given TL-Verilog code.
* [SandPiper SaaS Edition](https://pypi.org/project/sandpiper-saas/) runs as a microservice in the cloud to support easy open-source development. Install Sanpiper SaaS Edition for this project.

## Steps to run FPGA setup

1. `git clone https://github.com/os-fpga/Virtual-FPGA-Lab.git`
2.  From your working directory run the shell script `/<complete_path>/run.sh`.

3.  Three inputs will be asked by shell script

    a. Input file name of TL-Verilog file

    b. Board name (if board is not from given options then provide part number of board)
    
      If board is from given options:

    c. (Optional) If board is not from given options then constraints file should be present in your working directory as `<filename_partno>.xdc`.

       For example: From above iamge it should be `design_xc7a100tcsg324-1.xdc`
    
    d. Clock period (in ns)
