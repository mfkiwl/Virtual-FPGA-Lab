## What are FPGAs?

New to FPGAs? Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are hardware circuits that can be programmed to carry out logical operations. They provide a sweet spot between implementing algorithms in software and fabricating application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). They generally provide far better performance and power-efficiency than software implementations, and they require far less time and expense to implement than ASICs. They can be reprogrammed as needed to upgrade functionality or fix bugs, even after deployment to customers (in the "field"). FPGAs are also beneficial for prototyping application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) or processors.


## Virtual Lab Overview

Though far more accessible than ASICs, FPGAs can still be a bit costly and difficult to learn for beginners and students. That's where this project comes in... and it's not just for beginners.

This project builds on all the power and ease-of-use of [Makerchip IDE](http://makerchip.com/) and adds convenience for FPGA development. In particular, we take advantage of Makerchip's [__Visual Debug__ feature](https://redwoodeda.com/viz) to provide visualizations of FPGAs and their peripherals, thereby mimicking the physical lab experience. But better than the physical experience, you also have the benefits of simulation-based development: fast compilation (no synthesis, place-and-route, and bitstreams), full visibility of all signal values, and full control of time.

Makerchip further simplifies the experience with support for [TL-Verilog](http://tl-x.org/) in addition to Verilog/SystemVerilog. TL-Verilog features are more approachable to newcomers (not to mention the myriad benefits for experts).

In summary:

  - __Easy learning:__ Online; no board/peripherals required (but supported); simplified by TL-Verilog and Makerchip.
  - __Powerful for experts:__ (for open-source development) The virtual lab augments vendor tools with the benefits of Makerchip development and virtual FPGA board/peripheral integration.
  - __Vendor-agnostic:__ You're designs work on any FPGA boards with compatible peripherals. (Though currently-supported boards are all Xilinx-based.)
  - __Exportable:__ Code in Virtual Lab works on real FPGAs!!!
  - __Open Source:__ MIT-licensed.

## Development Flow

For simulation-based development, just click [here](http://www.makerchip.com/sandbox?code_url=https:%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FBalaDhinesh%2FVirtual-FPGA-Lab%2Fmain%2Fexamples%2Ffpga_lab.tlv), and go! _(Right-click to open in a new tab.)_ Instructions below will guide you.

You can also start from any of the [example project](#examples) here.

For deployment to an FPGA, clone this repository or any other repository that uses this virtual lab, and open a starting-point (TL-)Verilog file in Makerchip. 
Alternately, especially for local FPGA use, you can use [Makerchip-app](https://pypi.org/project/makerchip-app/) to edit files on your local machine (where you can maintain your git repository and run FPGA flows).

Once you have some logic running in simulation, you'll be able to export your design to any supported physical FPGA board using these [instructions](fpga/readme.md).


## Starting Template

```
\m4_TLV_version 1d: tl-x.org
\SV
   m4_include_lib(['https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BalaDhinesh/Virtual-FPGA-Lab/main/tlv_lib/fpga_includes.tlv'])
   
   m4_lab()

   // ... SystemVerilog or TL-Verilog FPGA logic goes here ...
   
\TLV
   /board
      // Board selection:
      // 0: M4_FIRST_CLAAS_ID
      // 1: M4_ZEDBOARD_ID
      // 2: M4_ARTIX7_ID
      // 3: M4_BASYS3_ID
      // 4: M4_ICEBREAKER_ID
      // 5: M4_NEXYS_ID
      // 6: M4_CLEAR_ID
      m4+board(/board, /fpga, 3, *)   // 3rd arg selects the board.
\SV

   endmodule

```

The `m4+board(...)` macro (and peripheral macros, such as `m4+lcd(...)`, define the hardware).

`m4_lab()` provides a superset of signals for I/Os. Those that have corresponding components on the board or peripherals should be driven/used. These include:

```
logic [15:0] led;             // corresponding LEDs are lit when asserted
logic [6:0] sseg_segment_n;   // corresponding segments are lit for selected digit(s) when deasserted 

logic sseg_decimal_point_n;   // decimal point is lit for selected digit(s) when deasserted
logic [7:0] sseg_digit_n;     // corresponding digits are enabled when deasserted

```

You can see these signal declarations in the one-line expansion of the `m4_lab()` macro instantiation in the NAV-TLV tab.


## Configuring and Driving the FPGA Board and Peripherals

#### Board

In the starting template, the 3rd argument below can be used to select the board:

```
// Board selection:
// 0 - 1st CLaaS on AWS F1
// 1 - Zedboard
// 2 - Artix-7
// 3 - Basys3
// 4 - Icebreaker
// 5 - Nexys
// 6 - CLEAR
m4+board(/board, /fpga, 3, *)   // 3rd arg selects the board.
```

Boards contain a subset of the following components,

## How to Add FPGA Boards and Peripherals

Board definitions appear at the top of the `fpga_includes.tlv` file. It should be easy
enough to interpret these parameters and add new boards by example. Be sure also to update all listings of available boards (which you can find using `git grep -i zedboard`).

The above steps update the virtual environment only. The physical FPGA build flow is a different matter and is platform-dependent, though open-source platform-agnostic build flows are available, and we'd love to use them.

We welcome your contributions.


## Visual Debug:

Makerchip's Visual Debug feature is used to create the Virtual FPGA Lab.

You can also use Visual Deubg to visualize the logic running inside the FPGA.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11302288/149048729-dd462221-6bd9-44b4-a2be-c61409234316.jpg">

### Visualizing your FPGA logic

By structuring your code to define your FPGA logic in TL-Verilog (which does not preclude using pure Verilog/SystemVerilog), you can add visualization to your logic.

Here's a sample code structure.

```
...
\SV
   m4_lab()

\TLV my_fpga_logic(/_fpga)
   // ... Your TL-Verilog FPGA logic along with it's visualization ...

\TLV
   /board
      m4+board(/board, /fpga, 3, *, , my_fpga_logic)
...
```

Visual Debug documentation and examples can be found within the Makerchip IDE.

## Future Scope

- To support more FPGA boards and peripherals.
- The automated shell script that converts TL-V code to run in an actual FPGA currently supports only Xilinx boards with Vivado software. So to provide scripts that target other vendors as well using open source tools. It would probably be wise to use EDAlize.
